<h1><center><u>RAPE</u></center></h1>
<h2><center><mark>Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. <br>
The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious,
 incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent.<br>
 The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.</mark></center></h2>
<h1>Section 375 of IPC:</h1>
<h2> This section of the Indian Penal Code delineates the criminal offense of rape and provides that a man is said to commit rape on a woman when he has sexual intercourse
 with her under any ofthe following circumstances:<br>

a. Against her will.<br>

b. Without her consent.<br>

c. With her consent but such consent being procured by putting her or any person close to her in fear of causing hurt or death.<br>

d. With her consent but such consent being given by her on a belief that he is the man with whom she has been lawfully married but that man being apprised of not being her husband.<br>

e. With her consent but at the time of giving such consent, the woman was impuissant to apprehend the nature and consequences of her consent.<br>

f. With or without her consent, when the woman is below the age of 16 years.<br>

Under this particular section of the IPC, a penetration would suffice to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary for the commission of the offense of rape.<br>

Additionally, for the purpose of this section, a woman’s consent to sexual intercourse involves her unequivocal and voluntary 
agreement or willingness to engage in the specific sexual act. Such consent may be evinced through words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication. However,
 if a woman does not try to physically intercept the act of penetration, the same cannot be regarded as consenting to the sexual activity.</h2><br>

<h1>Exceptions under Section 375:</h1>
<h2>It has been provided under this section that the act of sexual intercourse will not be considered rape in the following cases:<br>

a. When it is done by a man with his own wife; the wife not being under fifteen years of age.<br>

b. A medical procedure or intervention shall also not constitute rape.</h2>
